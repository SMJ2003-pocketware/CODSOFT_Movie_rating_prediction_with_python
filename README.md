In this project, I aimed to predict movie ratings using a dataset of IMDb movies from India. The first step involved cleaning the data, where I handled missing values by filling in the average rating for numerical columns and using the mode for missing year values. I also replaced missing values in categorical columns, such as the genre, director, and actors, with "Unknown" to avoid any data loss. Once the data was cleaned, I created some visualizations to explore how ratings vary with respect to the director and top actors. For example, I created bar plots to show average ratings for the top 10 directors and actors. Then, I used one-hot encoding to convert categorical variables into numerical format, so they could be used in machine learning models. I split the data into training and testing sets, trained a Random Forest Regressor model, and evaluated its performance using mean squared error. The whole process was a great way to understand how different features, like the director and actors, influence movie ratings and how I can use machine learning to predict those ratings.
